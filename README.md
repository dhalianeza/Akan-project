 ## BDD
 The application should check whether the date and month entered is valid. if either of them is invalid,  the user should be alerted and asked to enter a valid one. For example:
        An invalid day should be (d<=0) or (d>31)

        An invalid month should be (m<= 0) or (m > 12)  

The application should output to the user their Akan name depending on their gender. For example, if a user is male and the result of the calculation is 0, then the application should match that with Kwasi since Kwasi corresponds to Sunday which has an index 0. Hence the output the user will see should be something like “Your Akan name is Kwasi”
